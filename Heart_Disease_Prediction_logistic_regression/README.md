# Heart Disease Prediction

This program has used logistic regression algorithm to develop and train the model that could estimate the likelihood of heart disease based on important indicators associated with the condition. The model was then evaluated for its accuracy, precision, recall and auc scores. 

- Sex (Male or Female)
- Age Category
- Imputed race/ethnicity value (American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, Black, Hispanic, White and Other)
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Smoker (at least 100 cigarettes in his entire life)
- Heavy drinker
  - For adult men: having more than 14 drinks per week
  - For adult women: having more than 7 drinks per week
- Have/had a stroke
- Have/had a diabetes
- Doing physical activity or exercise during the past 30 days other than the regular job
- General health condition (Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good or Excellent)

The dataset were obtained from the website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease. We created synthetic samples as well to balance the data distribution among the predictor class.
